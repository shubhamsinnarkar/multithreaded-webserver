How to run the code?

First, run the server file named HTTPWebServer.

Now, your server is running.

You can open the browser by send a http request by:

http ∶ //localhost ∶ 8080/

Alternative: Enter the resource you are looking for in requestedResource. Run the client named HTTPWebClient. Check out results.

If resource is found, it will show HTTP/1.1 200 OK and all the logs respectively else will follow up with a 404 not found.

You can find server parameters on client side and client parameters on server side.

Also, once the request is addressed , you can find the RTT on client side.

We can observe that if we process the same request multiple times, RTT decreases.
